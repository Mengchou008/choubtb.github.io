        <p id="comment">Ta Dambang Kranhong sits on a roundabout in the center of the city.  This huge city statue seems to have attracted a lot of people and has just become a symbol of the city!  And for good reason, it represents the bat that, according to legend, originated in Battambang province.</p>
        <p id="comment">It all started with the rice turning black curiously ... having tasted it, the stick turned into a very powerful giant.  He took the opportunity of his new power to seize the throne.  His reign was seven years, seven months, and seven days.  When the man who was destined to drop him challenged him, Ta Dum threw the club after him.  But he missed the goal and it was still stuck far away to create Battambang!</p>
        <p id="comment">Exploring statues is an opportunity to give substance to the legend, but also just walk around the city center.</p>

        <p id="comment">Bamboo train (also known as Bamboo train or Norry) is the most famous attraction of Battambang province.  These bamboo platforms appeared in the 1970s.  The staff responsible for maintaining the rail then used it to move around, pushing themselves using long poles.  Later, Vietnamese soldiers will use it to move forward.  But the villagers who finally took the idea, tired of the poor condition of the road!</p>
        <p id="comment">Today, the railway network is limited to 4 km south of the city, and boat engines have replaced bamboo poles.  However, this special mode of transportation is still in use!  In Battambang, you can ask which tricycle will take you there.  Connect with Cambodians, Cambodians pass by in front of your eyes ... You will never have a chance to ride a bamboo train again!</p>

        <p id="comment">Visiting Battambang is an opportunity to taste the famous Angkor Wat temples.  Really thought for a long time that Banan pagoda is a model for the next generation!  If, in fact, its later construction (11th-12th centuries), this site still offers a great view of Khmer architecture.  To get there you will have to climb the 350 stairs that will take you to the top of Banan Mountain.  Beautiful scenery is waiting for you there!</p>
        <p id="comment">In addition to the remains of the temple and its five towers, you can visit the caves nearby.  In particular, do not forget the Venerable Cave.  Drinking water flowing through one of its stone temples is said to provide a glimpse of the past, present and future.</p>

        <p id="comment">Phnom Sampov is the second mountain in Battambang province.  Located 12 km southwest of the city, it is topped by a temple of the same name.  Here 700 steps are waiting for you!  But this match is really worth it because Phnom Sampov is a place with a lot of points of interest.  First, the temple, whose appearance is named after it (Sampeau means "ship").  But there are also golden stupas, places of worship, as well as statues of many Angkorian warriors.</p>
        <p id="comment">Moreover, the mountain was occupied by the Khmer Rouge and traces of the Dark Ages remain.  Along the way, you are likely to encounter monkeys.  Always a happy reunion!</p>
